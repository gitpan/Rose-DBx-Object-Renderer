Rose::DBx::Object::Renderer is a Perl module that generates forms, tables, menus, and charts for Rose::DB::Object. The generated UIs encapsulate sensible web conventions as default behaviours, such as rendering email addresses as 'mailto' links and enforce appropriate validation in forms. These default behaviours are highly configurable.

Rose::DBx::Object::Renderer uses CGI::FormBuilder to generate forms and the Google Chart API to render charts. Template::Toolkit is used for template processing, although UIs can be generated out of the box without using templates.
